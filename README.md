### How to Perform a Network Scan

A **network scan** is the process of discovering and mapping devices, services, and vulnerabilities within a network. It involves using tools to identify IP addresses, open ports, running services, and potential security issues.

Hereâ€™s how to do a basic network scan:

#### 1. **Identify the Scope**
   - Determine which devices and segments of the network you want to scan.
   - Ensure you have permission to scan the network, as unauthorized scanning can be illegal.

#### 2. **Select Scanning Tools**
   Common tools for network scanning include:
   - **Nmap** (Network Mapper): A powerful open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.
   - **Zenmap**: A GUI version of Nmap for easier usage.
   - **Angry IP Scanner**: A simple and lightweight scanner.
   - **Wireshark**: A packet analyzer for in-depth traffic inspection.

#### 3. **Run a Basic Scan**
   For **Nmap**, you can run different types of scans depending on the depth and detail required:

   - **Ping scan**: Checks which devices are live on the network.
     ```bash
     nmap -sn <target-ip-range>
     ```
   - **Port scan**: Identifies open ports on devices.
     ```bash
     nmap -p 1-65535 <target-ip>
     ```
   - **Service and version detection**: Identifies running services and their versions.
     ```bash
     nmap -sV <target-ip>
     ```
   - **Vulnerability scan**: Check for known vulnerabilities.
     ```bash
     nmap --script vuln <target-ip>
     ```

#### 4. **Analyze Results**
   - Identify any open or suspicious ports.
   - Look for outdated services or vulnerabilities.
   - Document findings for further investigation or patching.

#### 5. **Automated Scanning Solutions**
   If you're looking for an enterprise solution:
   - **OpenVAS**: An open-source vulnerability scanner.
   - **Nessus**: A professional-grade vulnerability scanning tool.

### Importance of Network Scanning

1. **Security**: It helps identify open ports, weak points, and vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.
2. **Asset Discovery**: Scanning reveals all devices connected to the network, which can help with inventory and management.
3. **Compliance**: For industries with regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA), regular network scanning is necessary to meet compliance standards.
4. **Incident Response**: Scans help identify compromised devices during or after a breach.
5. **Performance Monitoring**: It ensures that only authorized devices and services are running, improving network health and performance.
6. **Network Mapping**: Scans provide a visual representation of your network topology, improving documentation and troubleshooting.

Network scanning is a critical part of maintaining a secure and efficient network.
